# Health Place PHP Developer Techincal Assessment

Health Place provides multiple types of listings for search results, each with varying data structures. For example, an `app` will have an iOS and/or a Google Play Store URL, whereas a `face to face support group` will need an address.

You've been tasked with building a solution that will take any listing and return a JSON string structured for that listing type. The classes have been provided along with documentation for the expected output shapes.
